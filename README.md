## **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### **1. Clone the Repository**

First, clone or download the project from the GitHub repository:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/your-repo/alexa-clone.git
 cd alexa-clone
```

### **2. Get a Free Gemini API Key**

You need an API key from **Google's AI Studio** to use the Gemini AI services.

- Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
- Sign in with your Google account
- Generate a free API key
- Save the key for later use

### **3. Create a Python Virtual Environment**

Setting up a virtual environment ensures dependencies don’t interfere with system packages.

```bash
py -m venv env  # Create virtual environment
```

Activate the environment:

- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  env\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Mac/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

### **4. Install Required Dependencies**

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **5. Set Up Your API Key**

To securely store your API key, create a `.env` file in the project directory and add:

```plaintext
API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

## **Usage**

### **Text-Based Chat Assistant**

Run the following command to interact with the text-based AI assistant:

```bash
py text_gemini.py
```

### **Voice-Based AI Assistant**

Run this command to use the voice-enabled assistant:

```bash
py voice_gemini.py
```

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues and Fixes**

#### ❌ `Running Scripts is disabled on this machine`

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### ❌ `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xyz'`

✅ Ensure you've installed all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### ❌ `ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package`

✅ Try running the script as a module:

```bash
py -m text_gemini
```

#### ❌ API not responding

✅ Verify your `.env` file contains the correct API key.  
✅ Ensure your internet connection is working.
